**how Email works?**

SMTP protocol is used to send email
pop3 protocol is used to receive email
but email is transported?

**if we are sending a mail from yahoo to gmail :**

Sender is sending mail to senders smtp server then it makes connection with receiver smtp server then it receives to the receiver

**POP:**

client connects to pop server
then client asks all the email that i receives
it is done only in 1 device.

we can download and delete emails from the pop3

**IMAP:**

it allows to view our mails on multiple devices
General emails uses IMAP protocol

**DNS:**

Domain Name System
DNS are mapped to the ip addresses

it is very difficult to remember the ip addresses but it is easy to remember the DNS (names)

Now HTTP protocol uses DNS and it converts url into ip address then it connects to the server

mail.google.com

mail = sub domain

google = second - level domain
com =top level domain
